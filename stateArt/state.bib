abstract={The testing of a compiler is a difficult process, since often a very high quality product is expected by the user, particularly with respect to the compiler's correctness. This paper seeks to review the main methods that have been proposed for the automation of part of this process, using the automatic generation of test cases and the automatic checking of the results. It then summarises the advantages and disadvantages of the general approach and highlights several areas for further research.},
